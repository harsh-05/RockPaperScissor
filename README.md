# RockPaperScissor

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game that has been around for centuries. It's simple to play, yet surprisingly engaging, making it a popular choice for people of all ages.

In this project, I am building a web application using JavaScript that allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors in their free time. I would like to thank "The Odin Project" for creating the engaging structure and providing this exercise, which has challenged me to develop this application.
